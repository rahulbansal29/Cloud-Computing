# Cloud-Computing

 Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider.

1. Faster time to market
You can spin up new instances or retire them in seconds, allowing developers to accelerate development with quick deployments. Cloud computing supports new innovations by making it easy to test new ideas and design new applications without hardware limitations or slow procurement processes.

2. Scalability and flexibility
Cloud computing gives your business more flexibility. You can quickly scale resources and storage up to meet business demands without having to invest in physical infrastructure.
Companies don’t need to pay for or build the infrastructure needed to support their highest load levels. Likewise, they can quickly scale down if resources aren’t being used.  

3. Cost savings
Whatever cloud service model you choose, you only pay for the resources you actually use. This helps you avoid overbuilding and overprovisioning your data center and gives your IT teams back valuable time to focus on more strategic work. 

4. Better collaboration
Cloud storage enables you to make data available anywhere you are, anytime you need it. Instead of being tied to a location or specific device, people can access data from anywhere in the world from any device—as long as they have an internet connection.

5. Advanced security
Despite popular perceptions, cloud computing can actually strengthen your security posture because of the depth and breadth of security features, automatic maintenance, and centralized management.
Reputable cloud providers also hire top security experts and employ the most advanced solutions, providing more robust protection. 

6. Data loss prevention
Cloud providers offer backup and disaster recovery features. Storing data in the cloud rather than locally can help prevent data loss in the event of an emergency, such as hardware malfunction, malicious threats, or even simple user error. 



## Disadvantages Of Cloud

1. Downtime
Businesses receive cloud computing services only through the Internet. When there is an internet outage or weak connectivity, services get interrupted and this increases downtime. Therefore, one of the major criticisms of cloud computing is its high dependency on the Internet.

2. Security and Privacy
Data security and privacy threats are other disadvantages of cloud computing. According to a survey, nearly 98% of companies using cloud computing services experienced at least one data breach from 2020 to 2022. Inadequate cloud security measures lead to data leakage over cloud networks which can result in intellectual property theft, contract breaches, and malware attacks. Hackers can also control how companies provide services to their customers or end-users. This leads to a loss of business opportunities and a decrease in revenue.

3. Vulnerability to Attacks
Private clouds are considered the most secure for businesses in terms of data security. However, the cost of setting up private clouds is higher in comparison to public, hybrid, and multi-clouds. Therefore, many businesses prefer public, hybrid, and multi-cloud computing services. As these clouds provide services to multiple users over the same network, businesses become vulnerable to cyber attacks which can lead to data loss or data leakage. 

4. Limited Control and Flexibility
In public, hybrid, and community clouds, all cloud computing services are completely managed by cloud service providers. This offers limited control and flexibility to customers, restricting their access to various services and applications. Therefore, many companies enter into a separate end-user license agreements to gain control of the cloud’s services and applications.

5. Vendor Lock-in
Vendor lock-in refers to a situation where companies using cloud computing services of a particular vendor are unable to switch to a different vendor. This usually happens because of high switching costs, large amounts of data which is difficult to migrate, and several other complexities. In case of vendor lock-in, companies are forced to receive services from a particular vendor. This affects their operational workflow and efficiency.

6. Cost Concerns
Costs are both a significant advantage and disadvantage of cloud computing. While it helps small businesses avail quality services without investing large amounts to set up IT infrastructure, it can also increase expenditure for companies as there are several hidden costs involved which emerge at a later stage. These include data transfer, cloud utilization, and data migration costs.
